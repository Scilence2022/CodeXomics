# Search Results Panel

## Overview

The Electron Genome Browser now includes a dedicated search results panel that automatically appears in the sidebar when searches are performed. This panel provides an organized view of all search matches with click-to-navigate functionality.

## Features

### Automatic Display
- **Hidden by default**: The panel is not visible until a search is performed
- **Auto-show on search**: Automatically appears at the top of the sidebar when search results are found
- **Auto-hide on empty**: Hides automatically when no results are found

### Search Results Display
- **Organized list**: All search results displayed in a clean, organized list
- **Result types**: Visual badges distinguish between gene matches and sequence matches
- **Position information**: Shows exact genomic coordinates for each result
- **Detailed descriptions**: Includes gene names, types, and product descriptions

### Navigation Features
- **Click to navigate**: Click any result to jump to that genomic location
- **Auto-navigation**: Automatically navigates to the first result after searching
- **Context view**: Shows 500bp context around each result
- **Visual selection**: Highlights the currently selected result

### Result Information
Each search result displays:
- **Name**: Gene name, locus tag, or "Sequence match"
- **Type badge**: Color-coded badge (green for genes, blue for sequences)
- **Position**: Genomic coordinates (1-based)
- **Details**: Gene type and product description or sequence information

## Usage

### Performing a Search
1. Use the search functionality (header search or Ctrl+F modal)
2. Enter gene names or DNA sequences
3. Search results panel automatically appears if matches are found
4. First result is automatically selected and displayed

### Navigating Results
1. **Click any result** to navigate to that location
2. **Selected result** is highlighted with blue background and left border
3. **Status updates** show current result position and total count
4. **Context view** provides 500bp surrounding each match

### Panel Management
- **Close button**: Click the × to hide the search results panel
- **Persistent results**: Results remain available until a new search is performed
- **Sidebar integration**: Panel appears at the top of the sidebar sections

## Visual Design

### Result Items
- **Hover effects**: Subtle background change on mouse hover
- **Selection highlight**: Blue background and left border for selected items
- **Type badges**: Color-coded badges for easy identification
  - Green badges for gene matches
  - Blue badges for sequence matches
- **Compact layout**: Efficient use of space with clear information hierarchy

### Panel Header
- **Search summary**: Shows total number of matches and search term
- **Consistent styling**: Matches other sidebar panel headers
- **Close button**: Standard × button for hiding the panel

## Technical Implementation

### Search Integration
- **Unified results**: Combines gene name matches and sequence matches
- **Sorted display**: Results ordered by genomic position
- **Real-time updates**: Panel updates immediately when new searches are performed

### Navigation System
- **Context calculation**: Automatically calculates optimal view range
- **Position tracking**: Maintains current result index for navigation
- **Status updates**: Provides feedback on current position and total results

### Memory Management
- **Efficient storage**: Results stored in memory for quick navigation
- **Event handling**: Click handlers attached dynamically to result items
- **Cleanup**: Previous results cleared when new searches are performed

## Examples

### Gene Search Results
```
Search Results
Found 3 matches for "lacZ"

[gene] lacZ                    Position: 366-1,203
       CDS: beta-galactosidase

[gene] lacZYA operon          Position: 360-5,366
       regulatory: lac operon promoter

[sequence] Sequence match     Position: 2,847-2,852
       Found "lacZ" at position 2,848
```

### DNA Sequence Results
```
Search Results
Found 2 matches for "ATGCGATCG"

[sequence] Sequence match     Position: 1,234-1,242
       Found "ATGCGATCG" at position 1,235

[sequence] Reverse complement Position: 5,678-5,686
       Found reverse complement "CGATCGCAT" at position 5,679
```

## Benefits

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual organization**: Clear, organized display of all search results
- **Quick navigation**: One-click access to any search result
- **Persistent access**: Results remain available for continued exploration
- **Context awareness**: Automatic positioning with surrounding genomic context

### Improved Workflow
- **Efficient searching**: No need to repeat searches to access different results
- **Comparative analysis**: Easy switching between multiple search matches
- **Spatial awareness**: Clear understanding of result distribution across the genome
- **Integrated interface**: Seamless integration with existing sidebar functionality

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+F** (Cmd+F): Open search modal
- **Enter**: Execute search and populate results panel
- **Escape**: Close search modal (results panel remains open)
- **Click**: Navigate to specific search result

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate between results
- **Export functionality**: Save search results to file
- **Advanced filtering**: Filter results by type or position
- **Batch operations**: Perform actions on multiple results
- **Search history**: Access to previous search results
