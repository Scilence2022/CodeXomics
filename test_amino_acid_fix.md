# Test Case: Amino Acid Composition Analysis Fix

## Problem Fixed
The AI assistant was stuck in an infinite loop repeatedly calling `sequence_statistics` with the same parameters without getting amino acid composition data.

## Root Cause
1. `sequence_statistics` function was designed only for DNA sequences
2. The `sequenceType` parameter was ignored
3. AI kept getting nucleotide composition instead of amino acid composition

## Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced `sequence_statistics`**: Now properly handles both DNA and protein sequences based on `sequenceType` parameter
2. **Added `amino_acid_composition` tool**: Dedicated tool for protein analysis with detailed amino acid properties
3. **Fixed task completion**: Proper handling prevents infinite loops

## Correct Usage Examples

### Option 1: Using sequence_statistics with protein
```json
{
  "tool_name": "sequence_statistics",
  "parameters": {
    "sequence": "MTIFDNYEVWFVIGSQHLYGPETLR...",
    "sequenceType": "protein"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Using dedicated amino_acid_composition tool
```json
{
  "tool_name": "amino_acid_composition", 
  "parameters": {
    "proteinSequence": "MTIFDNYEVWFVIGSQHLYGPETLR...",
    "geneName": "araA"
  }
}
```

## Expected Results
Now the amino acid composition analysis should return:
- Individual amino acid counts and percentages
- Biochemical properties (hydrophobic, charged, polar, etc.)
- Most/least abundant amino acids
- Proper task completion without loops

## Test Commands for araA gene
1. `search_gene_by_name` → find araA gene
2. `get_coding_sequence` → get protein sequence  
3. `amino_acid_composition` → analyze composition ✅

This should work correctly without infinite loops now!
