## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Data Storage**
- **Session Persistence**: Features stored in memory during browser session
- **Chromosome Organization**: Features organized by chromosome for efficient access
- **JSON Structure**: Simple object format for easy serialization
- **No File Modification**: Original genome files remain unchanged

### **Visual Rendering**
```javascript
// User features get special styling
if (feature.isUserDefined) {
    geneElement.style.border = '2px dashed #10b981';
    geneElement.style.backgroundColor = 'rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1)';
    // Add edit icon overlay
    const editIcon = document.createElement('span');
    editIcon.className = 'edit-icon';
    editIcon.innerHTML = '‚úèÔ∏è';
}
```

### **Integration with Existing System**
- **Unified Display**: User features appear alongside loaded annotations
- **Search Integration**: User features included in search results
- **Track Rendering**: Seamless integration with gene track visualization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles overlapping features gracefully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

### **Current Limitations**
- **Session Persistence**: Features lost when browser closes (no file saving yet)
- **Export Options**: Cannot export user features to standard formats (planned)
- **Editing Capability**: No direct editing of created features (planned)
- **Batch Operations**: No bulk import/export functionality (planned)

### **Best Practices**
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names for easy identification
- **Consistent Naming**: Develop naming conventions for project consistency
- **Documentation**: Include detailed descriptions for complex annotations
- **Regular Screenshots**: Save important views as images for documentation

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Memory Usage**: Large numbers of features may impact performance
- **Rendering Speed**: Complex overlapping features may slow visualization
- **Search Performance**: Many features may slow search operations

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Persistent Storage**: Save features to files for permanent storage
- **Export Functionality**: Export to GFF, BED, and other standard formats
- **Feature Editing**: Direct editing and deletion of created features

- **Version Control**: Track changes and annotations over time
- **Integration**: Direct connection to annotation databases

### **User Experience Improvements**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Faster feature creation workflows
- **Templates**: Pre-defined feature templates for common use cases
- **Batch Operations**: Create multiple features simultaneously
- **Advanced Search**: Complex queries across user annotations

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Feature not appearing**:
- Check that coordinates are within sequence bounds
- Verify feature name doesn't conflict with existing annotations
- Ensure proper strand selection for visualization

**Coordinates incorrect**:
- Remember coordinates are 1-based (first base is position 1)
- Start position must be less than or equal to end position
- Check chromosome/sequence length limits

**Visual styling issues**:
- User features should have dashed green borders
- If styling missing, check browser compatibility
- Ensure no CSS conflicts with custom stylesheets

**Performance problems**:
- Limit number of features to reasonable amounts (<1000)
- Avoid very long feature names or descriptions
- Consider using more specific genomic regions

### **Technical Support**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify genome file is properly loaded before adding features
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled and running properly
- Contact support with specific error messages and reproduction steps

This user-defined features system provides a powerful and intuitive way to enhance genome annotation directly within the browser, making it an essential tool for researchers, educators, and anyone working with genomic data.
