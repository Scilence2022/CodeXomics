# Secondary Ruler Sequence Selection Implementation

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive sequence selection functionality for the secondary ruler (detailed ruler) in the Genes & Features track. This feature allows users to select genomic regions directly from the secondary ruler, providing an intuitive way to select sequences and automatically highlighting corresponding features in the Genes & Features track.

## Key Features

### 1. Selection Button in Track Header
- **Location**: Genes & Features track header, positioned to the left of existing buttons
- **Icon**: Mouse pointer (FontAwesome `fa-mouse-pointer`)
- **Styling**: Consistent with other track header buttons
- **Functionality**: Toggles selection mode for the secondary ruler
- **Visual Feedback**: Button changes color (white â†’ blue) when active

### 2. Secondary Ruler Selection Mode
- **Activation**: Click selection button to enable/disable mode
- **Cursor Change**: Crosshair cursor appears on secondary ruler
- **Interaction**: Click and drag on ruler to select regions
- **Visual Indicator**: Blue selection rectangle with handles during drag
- **Real-time Feedback**: Tooltip showing selection details

### 3. Feature Highlighting Integration
- **Automatic Highlighting**: Features overlapping with selection are highlighted
- **Visual Styling**: Blue borders, shadows, and hover effects
- **CSS Classes**: `.feature-highlighted` for consistent styling
- **Clear Highlights**: Previous highlights are cleared when new selection is made

### 4. Sequence Track Integration
- **Copy Button Activation**: Automatically activates when selection is made
- **Selection State**: Integrates with existing `currentSequenceSelection`
- **Source Tracking**: Marks selection source as 'secondary-ruler'
- **State Management**: Proper clearing and synchronization

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/renderer/modules/TrackRenderer.js`

**New Properties:**
```javascript
// Secondary ruler selection state
this.secondaryRulerSelection = null;
```

**New Methods:**
- `toggleSecondaryRulerSelection(trackType)` - Handles mode switching
- `setupSecondaryRulerSelection(detailedRuler)` - Sets up event listeners
- `handleSecondaryRulerMouseDown(e)` - Handles mouse down events
- `handleSecondaryRulerMouseMove(e)` - Handles mouse move events
- `handleSecondaryRulerMouseUp(e)` - Handles mouse up events
- `createSecondaryRulerSelectionIndicator(canvas)` - Creates visual indicator
- `updateSecondaryRulerSelectionIndicator()` - Updates indicator position
- `applySecondaryRulerSelection(start, end)` - Applies selection to genome browser
- `clearSecondaryRulerSelection()` - Clears selection state
- `highlightSelectedRegion(start, end)` - Highlights overlapping features
- `disableTrackDragging(trackContent)` - Disables track dragging during selection mode
- `enableTrackDragging(trackContent)` - Re-enables track dragging after selection mode

**Modified Methods:**
- `createTrackHeader()` - Added selection button for Genes & Features track
- `getCurrentViewport()` - Added fallback for viewport access

#### 2. `src/renderer/styles.css`

**New CSS Classes:**
```css
/* Secondary ruler selection mode */
.detailed-ruler-container.selecting {
    pointer-events: auto;
}

.detailed-ruler-container.selecting .detailed-ruler-canvas {
    pointer-events: auto;
    cursor: crosshair !important;
}

/* Secondary ruler selection indicator */
.secondary-ruler-selection {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    height: 100%;
    background: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3);
    border: 2px solid #3b82f6;
    pointer-events: none;
    z-index: 25;
    border-radius: 2px;
}

/* Track selection button styles */
.track-selection-btn:hover {
    color: #3b82f6;
    border-color: #3b82f6;
    background: #f0f9ff;
}

.track-selection-btn.active {
    background: #3b82f6 !important;
    color: #ffffff !important;
    border-color: #3b82f6 !important;
    box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3);
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Button Integration
The selection button is added to the Genes & Features track header using the existing `createTrackHeader()` method. It's positioned to the left of existing buttons and uses consistent styling.

```javascript
// Add sequence selection button for Genes & Features track
if (trackType === 'genes') {
    const selectionBtn = document.createElement('button');
    selectionBtn.className = 'track-btn track-selection-btn';
    selectionBtn.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></i>';
    selectionBtn.title = 'Toggle sequence selection mode on secondary ruler';
    selectionBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        this.toggleSecondaryRulerSelection(trackType);
    });
    buttonsContainer.appendChild(selectionBtn);
}
```

### 2. Selection Mode Toggle
The toggle function manages the selection mode state and updates visual feedback:

```javascript
toggleSecondaryRulerSelection(trackType) {
    if (trackType !== 'genes') return;
    
    const detailedRuler = geneTrack.querySelector('.detailed-ruler-container');
    const isSelecting = detailedRuler.classList.contains('selecting');
    
    if (isSelecting) {
        // Exit selection mode
        detailedRuler.classList.remove('selecting');
        detailedRuler.style.cursor = 'default';
        this.clearSecondaryRulerSelection();
    } else {
        // Enter selection mode
        detailedRuler.classList.add('selecting');
        detailedRuler.style.cursor = 'crosshair';
    }
}
```

### 3. Mouse Event Handling
The implementation uses mouse events to handle selection:

- **Mouse Down**: Records start position and creates selection indicator
- **Mouse Move**: Updates selection end position and indicator
- **Mouse Up**: Applies final selection and highlights features

### 4. Visual Feedback
Selection provides comprehensive visual feedback:

- **Button State**: Changes color and appearance when active
- **Cursor**: Crosshair cursor on secondary ruler
- **Selection Indicator**: Blue rectangle showing selected region
- **Feature Highlighting**: Blue borders and shadows on overlapping features

### 5. State Management
Proper state management ensures consistency:

- **Clear Previous**: Removes existing selections and highlights
- **Apply Selection**: Updates genome browser state
- **Sync Components**: Ensures Sequence Track and Copy button are updated
- **Source Tracking**: Marks selection source for debugging

## Integration Points

### 1. Genome Browser Integration
- Uses existing `currentSequenceSelection` state
- Integrates with `sequenceSelection` object
- Updates `updateCopyButtonState()` method
- Uses `showNotification()` for user feedback

### 2. Feature Highlighting
- Finds overlapping features using position comparison
- Applies `.feature-highlighted` CSS class
- Clears previous highlights before applying new ones
- Uses `data-feature-id` attributes for targeting

### 3. Sequence Track Integration
- Activates Copy button when selection is made
- Integrates with existing sequence selection state
- Maintains consistency with primary ruler selection

### 4. Track Dragging Control
- **Disable During Selection**: Automatically disables track dragging and mouse following when selection mode is enabled
- **Re-enable After Selection**: Restores track dragging functionality when selection mode is disabled
- **State Preservation**: Stores and restores original cursor, title, and pointer events
- **Event Listener Management**: Properly removes and re-adds drag event listeners through NavigationManager
