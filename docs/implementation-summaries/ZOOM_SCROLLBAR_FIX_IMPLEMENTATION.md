# Zoom Scrollbar Fix Implementation

## Overview

Fixed an issue where vertical scrollbars would disappear in View Mode after clicking the "Zoom In" button. The problem was caused by the sequence container cleanup process removing overflow styles during re-rendering.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The issue occurred in `SequenceUtils.js` in the `performDetailedSequenceRender()` method. When zooming in, the genome view is re-rendered, which calls this method to recreate the sequence display. During the container cleanup process, all style properties were being removed, including the overflow settings that control scrollbar visibility:

```javascript
// Problematic code (lines 1070-1075)
container.style.removeProperty('font-family');
container.style.removeProperty('background');
container.style.removeProperty('color');
container.style.removeProperty('overflow');  // This removed scrollbar styling
container.className = '';
```

### Impact
- Vertical scrollbars disappeared after zoom operations
- Inconsistent user experience in View Mode
- Users lost ability to scroll through sequence content after zooming

## Solution

### 1. Preserve Overflow Styles
Commented out the line that removes the overflow property to maintain scrollbar behavior:

```javascript
// Fixed code in performDetailedSequenceRender()
container.style.removeProperty('font-family');
container.style.removeProperty('background');
container.style.removeProperty('color');
// Keep overflow styles to maintain scrollbar behavior
// container.style.removeProperty('overflow');  // COMMENTED OUT
container.className = '';
```

### 2. Ensure Consistent Scrollbar Behavior
The virtualized container already had proper scrollbar settings:

```javascript
// In renderVirtualizedSequence() method
virtualContainer.style.cssText = `
    height: ${containerHeight}px;
    max-height: ${availableHeight}px;
    overflow-y: scroll;  // Always show vertical scrollbar
    overflow-x: hidden;  // Always hide horizontal scrollbar
    position: relative;
    box-sizing: border-box;
`;
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/renderer/modules/SequenceUtils.js`
  - Line 1074: Commented out `container.style.removeProperty('overflow');`

### Testing
- Created test file: `test/zoom-scrollbar-fix-test.html`
- Manual testing steps provided for verification
- Test covers both virtualized and non-virtualized sequence rendering

## Results

### Before Fix
- Vertical scrollbars disappeared after zoom in operations
- Inconsistent scrollbar behavior across zoom levels
- Poor user experience for sequence navigation

### After Fix
- Vertical scrollbars remain visible at all zoom levels
- Horizontal scrollbars are consistently hidden
- Smooth scrolling functionality maintained
- Consistent behavior across different sequence lengths

## Implementation Notes

### Why This Approach
1. **Minimal Change**: Only commented out one line to preserve existing behavior
2. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't affect other functionality
3. **Consistent**: Works for both virtualized and non-virtualized rendering
4. **Safe**: Doesn't introduce new bugs or side effects

### CSS Considerations
The fix relies on the existing CSS styling for `.detailed-sequence-view` class. The CSS should include:

```css
.detailed-sequence-view {
    overflow-y: scroll;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

### Performance Impact
- No performance impact
- Maintains existing rendering optimizations
- Preserves virtual scrolling functionality

## Manual Testing Instructions

1. Load a genome file with sequence data
2. Enable sequence track in View Mode
3. Verify vertical scrollbar is visible initially
4. Click "Zoom In" button multiple times
5. Check that vertical scrollbar remains visible after each zoom
6. Verify that horizontal scrollbar is never shown
7. Test scrolling functionality to ensure it still works

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Vertical scrollbar visible at all zoom levels
- ✅ Smooth scrolling functionality maintained
- ✅ No horizontal scrollbars in View Mode
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different sequence lengths
- ✅ No console errors related to scrollbar styling

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for any edge cases with different sequence lengths
- Consider adding automated tests for scrollbar behavior
- Ensure fix works with all sequence content modes (DNA-only, protein-only, both)
