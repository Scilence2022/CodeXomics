# Sequence Settings Tab Height Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The user reported that the view-mode-tab div in the Sequence Track Settings only had the height of the tab buttons, meaning the tab content was not visible even though it was being generated correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the CSS styling for the sequence settings tabs:

1. **Tab Panel Height**: The `.sequence-settings-tabs .tab-panel` elements had no minimum height defined
2. **Tab Content Container**: The `.sequence-settings-tabs .tab-content` container was not explicitly sized
3. **Content Clipping**: Tab panels were being rendered but with insufficient height to display their content

## Technical Solution

### CSS Changes Applied
Updated `src/renderer/styles.css` with the following fixes:

```css
.sequence-settings-tabs .tab-panel {
    display: none;
    min-height: 300px; /* Added minimum height */
    padding: 15px;     /* Added padding for better spacing */
}

.sequence-settings-tabs .tab-panel.active {
    display: block !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    height: auto !important;
    min-height: 300px !important; /* Ensured active panels have adequate height */
    overflow: visible !important;
    position: static !important;
    left: auto !important;
}

/* Ensure tab content container is properly sized */
.sequence-settings-tabs .tab-content {
    display: block !important;  /* Explicit display override */
    min-height: 300px;          /* Minimum container height */
    overflow: visible;          /* Prevent content clipping */
}
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Minimum Height**: Set 300px minimum height for both tab panels and content container
2. **Explicit Display**: Added `display: block !important` to tab content container
3. **Proper Padding**: Added 15px padding to tab panels for better content spacing
4. **Overflow Management**: Ensured content is not clipped with `overflow: visible`

## Testing
Created comprehensive test file `test-sequence-settings-height-fix.html` that:

- Generates identical sequence settings content
- Measures tab panel heights and visibility
- Provides detailed logging of DOM element dimensions
- Validates tab switching functionality
- Confirms content is properly displayed

## Files Modified
- `src/renderer/styles.css` - CSS height fixes
- `test-sequence-settings-height-fix.html` - Comprehensive test suite (new file)

## Verification Steps
1. Open the test file in a browser
2. Click "Open Sequence Settings" 
3. Verify both View Mode and Edit Mode tabs display content with proper height
4. Use "Test Height Measurements" to confirm panel dimensions are adequate (>= 300px)
5. Switch between tabs to ensure functionality works correctly

## Expected Results
- Tab panels now display with minimum 300px height
- All settings content is visible and properly spaced
- Tab switching works smoothly
- Content is no longer clipped or hidden
- Both View Mode and Edit Mode settings are fully accessible
