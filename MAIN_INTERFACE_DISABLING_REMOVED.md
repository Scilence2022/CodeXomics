# Main Interface Disabling Functionality Removed

## Changes Made

The LLM Instruction Following Benchmark interface previously implemented a main interface disabling functionality that would hide all main application content when the benchmark interface was opened. This functionality has been completely removed as requested.

## Specific Changes

### 1. ✅ Removed hideMainContent() Method
**File**: `/src/renderer/modules/BenchmarkUI.js`
- **Deleted**: `hideMainContent()` method (lines ~702-741)
- **Functionality**: This method would hide main interface elements including:
  - `.genome-browser-container`
  - `.genome-content`
  - `.main-canvas-container`
  - `.sidebar`
  - `.chatbox`
  - `.main-content:not(#benchmarkInterface)`
  - `.content-area`
  - `.genome-viewer`
  - `.tab-container`
  - `.header`
  - `.menu-bar`
  - `.toolbar`

### 2. ✅ Removed showMainContent() Method
**File**: `/src/renderer/modules/BenchmarkUI.js`
- **Deleted**: `showMainContent()` method (lines ~743-752)
- **Functionality**: This method would restore previously hidden main interface elements

### 3. ✅ Updated showBenchmarkInterface() Method
**File**: `/src/renderer/modules/BenchmarkUI.js`
- **Removed**: Call to `this.hideMainContent()` from the method
- **Result**: Benchmark interface now appears as an overlay without hiding main content

### 4. ✅ Updated closeBenchmarkInterface() Method
**File**: `/src/renderer/modules/BenchmarkUI.js`
- **Removed**: Call to `this.showMainContent()` from the method
- **Result**: Closing benchmark interface no longer attempts to restore main content

### 5. ✅ Updated exitBenchmarkMode() Method
**File**: `/src/renderer/modules/BenchmarkUI.js`
- **Removed**: Call to `this.showMainContent()` from the method
- **Result**: Exiting benchmark mode no longer attempts to restore main content

## Current Behavior

### Before Changes (❌ Problematic)
- Opening benchmark interface would completely hide all main application content
- Users could not access the main interface while benchmark was running
- Main content would only be restored when closing the benchmark interface

### After Changes (✅ Correct)
- Benchmark interface appears as an overlay with collapsible functionality
- Main application content remains fully accessible underneath
- Users can use the collapse/expand functionality to switch between benchmark and main interface
- No main content is ever hidden or disabled

## Interface Design

The benchmark interface now works as intended:

1. **Overlay Mode**: Interface appears as a high z-index overlay (`z-index: 999999`)
2. **Collapsible**: Users can minimize to title bar or expand to full view
3. **Non-Intrusive**: Main application remains fully functional underneath
4. **User Control**: Users choose when to interact with benchmark vs. main interface

## Benefits

- ✅ **Non-Disruptive**: Main application functionality is never interrupted
- ✅ **User Choice**: Users can switch between interfaces as needed
- ✅ **Better UX**: Can monitor test progress while using main application features
- ✅ **Proper Separation**: Benchmark interface is truly an overlay tool, not a replacement interface

## Testing Verification

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. **Open Benchmark Interface**: `Options → Benchmark & Debug Tools → Open Benchmark`
2. **Verify Main Access**: Confirm main application elements are still visible and functional underneath the benchmark overlay
3. **Test Collapsible**: Use minimize/expand to switch between interfaces
4. **Confirm No Hiding**: Verify no main content is hidden when benchmark interface is active

The main interface disabling functionality has been completely removed as requested. The benchmark interface now functions properly as a non-intrusive overlay tool.
