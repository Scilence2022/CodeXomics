    thought: "User wants to identify potential coding regions in a DNA sequence"
    expected_result: "List of ORFs with start/stop positions and potential proteins"
  
  - user_query: "Look for reading frames in both strands"
    tool_call: "find_orfs(sequence='ATGAAATAGTGA', include_reverse=true)"
