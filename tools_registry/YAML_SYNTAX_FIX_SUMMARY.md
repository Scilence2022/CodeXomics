# YAML Syntax Fix Summary

## Issue Encountered

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to load tool genome_codon_usage_analysis: 
YAMLException: bad indentation of a mapping entry (36:56)
```

## Root Cause

The YAML parser (`js-yaml`) was interpreting colons (`:`) within unquoted description strings as mapping entry separators, causing indentation errors.

### Problematic Lines

```yaml
# ❌ INCORRECT - Unquoted string with colon
description: Type of features to analyze (default: CDS)
description: Minimum feature length in base pairs to include in analysis (default: 300)
description: Specific chromosome/contig to analyze (optional, analyzes all chromosomes if not specified)
```

The colons in `(default: CDS)` and `(default: 300)` were being parsed as YAML mapping separators instead of literal characters.

## Solution

Quote all description strings containing colons or use alternative phrasing:

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Quoted strings
description: "Type of features to analyze (default CDS)"
description: "Minimum feature length in base pairs to include in analysis (default 300)"
description: "Specific chromosome/contig to analyze (optional, analyzes all chromosomes if not specified)"
```

### Alternative Solution (without quotes)

Remove or replace colons in descriptions:

```yaml
# ✅ ALSO CORRECT - No colons needed
description: Type of features to analyze (default is CDS)
description: Minimum feature length in base pairs to include in analysis (default is 300)
```

## Files Modified

**File:** `/tools_registry/data_management/genome_codon_usage_analysis.yaml`

**Changes:**
- Line 28: Added quotes to `chromosome` description
- Line 36: Removed colon from `featureType` description (changed `: CDS` to `CDS`)
- Line 44: Removed colon from `minLength` description (changed `: 300` to `300`)
- Line 49: Added quotes to `maxGenes` description
- Line 55: Added quotes to `clientId` description

## YAML Best Practices Learned

### 1. **Quote Strings with Special Characters**

Always quote strings containing:
- Colons (`:`)
- Brackets (`[]`, `{}`)
- Quotes (`"`, `'`)
- Hash/pound (`#`)
- Ampersand (`&`)
- Asterisk (`*`)
- Question mark (`?`)
- Pipe (`|`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Dash at start (`-`)

**Example:**
```yaml
# ❌ BAD
description: This is a test: example

# ✅ GOOD
description: "This is a test: example"
```

### 2. **Multi-line Strings with Colons**

For complex multi-line strings containing colons, use literal block scalar (`|`) or folded scalar (`>`):

```yaml
# ✅ Using literal block scalar
returns:
  result: |
    object - Analysis results including:
      - field1: description
      - field2: another description
```

**Note:** Even with `|`, nested items with colons can cause issues if they look like mapping entries.

### 3. **Enum Arrays**

Use consistent formatting for arrays:

```yaml
# ✅ PREFERRED - Multi-line format
enum:
  - "CDS"
  - "gene"
  - "mRNA"

# ✅ ALSO VALID - Inline format (but can cause issues with complex values)
enum: ["CDS", "gene", "mRNA"]
```

For this project, multi-line format is preferred for clarity and to avoid indentation ambiguity.

## Verification

After fixes, the tool now loads successfully:

```bash
$ node test_yaml_parsing.js
✅ YAML parsed successfully!

Tool details:
  Name: genome_codon_usage_analysis
  Version: 1.0.0
  Category: data_management
  Priority: 2
  Parameters: 5 defined
```

## Prevention Guidelines

### For New Tool Definitions

1. **Always quote descriptions** if they contain parentheses with default values
2. **Use multi-line format** for enums and arrays
3. **Test YAML parsing** before committing:
   ```bash
   node test_yaml_parsing.js
   ```
4. **Run verification script**:
   ```bash
   node verify_codon_analysis_enhancement.js
   ```

### YAML Validation Checklist

Before committing new YAML files:

- [ ] All descriptions with colons are quoted
- [ ] Multi-line strings use `|` or `>` appropriately
- [ ] Enum arrays use multi-line format
- [ ] No tab characters (use spaces only)
- [ ] Consistent indentation (2 spaces per level)
- [ ] Test parsing with `js-yaml` library
- [ ] Verify in registry_manager.js

- **Project Tool Registry Guide**: `/tools_registry/README.md`

## Conclusion

The YAML syntax error was caused by unquoted strings containing colons. By quoting all descriptions with special characters and using proper multi-line formatting, the tool now loads correctly and is ready for use.

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - All 19 verification tests passing
