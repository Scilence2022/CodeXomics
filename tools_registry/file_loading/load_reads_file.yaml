# Usage examples
sample_usages:
  - user_query: "Load reads file at /path/to/aligned.bam"
    tool_call: '{"tool_name": "load_reads_file", "parameters": {"filePath": "/path/to/aligned.bam", "showFileDialog": false}}'
    expected_result: "Successfully loads the BAM reads file directly"
  
  - user_query: "Open file dialog to select a reads file"
    tool_call: '{"tool_name": "load_reads_file", "parameters": {"showFileDialog": true}}'
    expected_result: "Opens file dialog for reads file selection"
    
  - user_query: "Load sequencing data from reads.sam"
    tool_call: '{"tool_name": "load_reads_file", "parameters": {"filePath": "reads.sam"}}'
    expected_result: "Loads SAM file containing sequencing reads"
