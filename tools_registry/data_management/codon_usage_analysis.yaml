sample_usages:
  - user_query: Analyze codon usage in this DNA sequence
    tool_call: codon_usage_analysis(sequence="ATGGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG", include_statistics=true, normalize_sequence=true)
    thought: User wants to analyze codon usage patterns in the provided DNA sequence
    expected_result: Detailed codon usage statistics and frequency analysis
  - user_query: codon usage analysis of lacZ gene
    tool_call: codon_usage_analysis(sequence="ATGAAACCCGGGTTT", genetic_code="standard", include_statistics=true)
    thought: User wants codon usage analysis for the lacZ gene sequence
    expected_result: Codon frequency analysis showing usage bias and statistics
