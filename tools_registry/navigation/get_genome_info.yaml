sample_usages:
  - user_query: "What genome is loaded?"
    tool_call: "get_genome_info(include_statistics=true)"
    thought: "User wants basic information about the currently loaded genome"
    expected_result: "Genome name, organism, chromosomes, and basic statistics"
  
  - user_query: "Tell me about the chromosomes"
    tool_call: "get_genome_info(include_chromosomes=true, include_statistics=false)"
    thought: "User specifically wants chromosome information"
    expected_result: "List of chromosomes with names, lengths, and features"
  
  - user_query: "Show genome overview"
    tool_call: "get_genome_info()"
    thought: "User wants comprehensive genome information"
    expected_result: "Complete genome overview including all available details"
