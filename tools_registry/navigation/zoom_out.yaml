sample_usages:
  - user_query: zoom out 2x
    tool_call: zoom_out(factor=2)
    thought: User wants to zoom out by 2x for broader view
    expected_result: View is zoomed out by 2x showing more context
  - user_query: zoom out to see more context
    tool_call: zoom_out(factor=3)
    thought: User wants broader context view
    expected_result: View is zoomed out by 3x for wider context
  - user_query: reduce the zoom level
    tool_call: zoom_out(factor=2)
    thought: User wants to reduce zoom using default factor
    expected_result: View is zoomed out by default 2x factor
  - user_query: show me the bigger picture
    tool_call: zoom_out(factor=5)
    thought: User wants much broader view of the genomic region
    expected_result: View is zoomed out by 5x for overview perspective

error_handling:
  no_data:
    error: "No genome data loaded for zooming"
    solution: "Load genome data first before zooming"
    retry: false
  invalid_factor:
    error: "Invalid zoom factor specified"
    solution: "Use zoom factor between 1.1 and 10"
    retry: true
  zoom_limit:
    error: "Cannot zoom beyond minimum resolution"
    solution: "Current zoom level is at maximum overview"
    retry: false
returns:
  success: "boolean - Whether zoom operation was successful"
  result: "object - Zoom operation results including:
    - factor: number - Applied zoom factor
    - newRange: object - New view range after zoom
    - oldRange: object - Previous view range
    - currentPosition: object - Current position after zoom"
  error: "string - Error message if success is false"
  error_type: "string - Type of error for proper handling"
