  required:
    - geneName
sample_usages:
  - user_query: Navigate to lysC gene
    tool_call: jump_to_gene(geneName='lysC')
    thought: User wants to directly navigate to the lysC gene, use primary navigation tool
    expected_result: Browser navigates directly to lysC gene location
  - user_query: Go to lacZ
    tool_call: jump_to_gene(geneName='lacZ')
    thought: Direct navigation request to lacZ gene
    expected_result: Browser jumps to lacZ gene position
  - user_query: Jump to gene b0062
    tool_call: jump_to_gene(geneName='b0062')
    thought: User wants to navigate to specific locus tag
    expected_result: Browser navigates to gene b0062 location
