sample_usages:
  - user_query: "Find all ribosomal proteins"
    tool_call: "search_features(query='ribosomal', feature_type='CDS')"
    thought: "User wants to search for features related to ribosomes, filtering by CDS type"
    expected_result: "List of all CDS features containing 'ribosomal' in name or annotation"
  
  - user_query: "Search for tRNA features"
    tool_call: "search_features(query='tRNA', feature_type='tRNA')"
    thought: "User wants to find all tRNA features"
    expected_result: "List of all tRNA features in the genome"
  
  - user_query: "Find transport-related genes"
    tool_call: "search_features(query='transport', exact_match=false)"
    thought: "User wants features related to transport functions using partial matching"
    expected_result: "List of features with transport-related annotations"
  
  - user_query: "Look for kinase enzymes"
    tool_call: "search_features(query='kinase', case_sensitive=false, max_results=20)"
    thought: "User searching for kinase-related features with case-insensitive matching"
    expected_result: "Up to 20 features containing 'kinase' in their annotations"
