sample_usages:
  - user_query: "What's the current state of the browser?"
    tool_call: "get_current_state(include_tracks=true, include_data_summary=true)"
    thought: "User wants to know the current browser state including tracks and data"
    expected_result: "Complete browser state with position, tracks, and loaded data information"
  
  - user_query: "Where am I currently in the genome?"
    tool_call: "get_current_state()"
    thought: "User wants to know current genomic position and context"
    expected_result: "Current chromosome, position range, and visible features"
  
  - user_query: "Show me the current session information"
    tool_call: "get_current_state(include_data_summary=true)"
    thought: "User wants current state with focus on loaded data"
    expected_result: "Current browser state including summary of loaded files and data"
