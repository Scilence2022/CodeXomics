sample_usages:
  - user_query: zoom in 2x
    tool_call: zoom_in(factor=2)
    thought: User wants to zoom in by 2x
    expected_result: View is zoomed in by 2x showing more detail
  - user_query: zoom in 10x to see features
    tool_call: zoom_in(factor=10)
    thought: User wants maximum zoom to see detailed features
    expected_result: View is zoomed in by 10x for maximum detail
  - user_query: magnify the current view
    tool_call: zoom_in(factor=2)
    thought: User wants to magnify the view using default factor
    expected_result: View is magnified by default 2x factor
  - user_query: zoom in to focus on the region
    tool_call: zoom_in(factor=3)
    thought: User wants to focus on current region with moderate zoom
    expected_result: View is zoomed in by 3x for better focus

error_handling:
  no_data:
    error: "No genome data loaded for zooming"
    solution: "Load genome data first before zooming"
    retry: false
  invalid_factor:
    error: "Invalid zoom factor specified"
    solution: "Use zoom factor between 1.1 and 10"
    retry: true
  zoom_limit:
    error: "Cannot zoom beyond maximum resolution"
    solution: "Current zoom level is at maximum detail"
    retry: false
returns:
  success: "boolean - Whether zoom operation was successful"
  result: "object - Zoom operation results including:
    - factor: number - Applied zoom factor
    - newRange: object - New view range after zoom
    - oldRange: object - Previous view range
    - currentPosition: object - Current position after zoom"
  error: "string - Error message if success is false"
  error_type: "string - Type of error for proper handling"
