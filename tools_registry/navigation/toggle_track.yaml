sample_usages:
  - user_query: "Hide the gene track"
    tool_call: "toggle_track(track_name='genes', action='hide')"
    thought: "User wants to hide the genes track from the browser view"
    expected_result: "Genes track becomes invisible in the browser"
  
  - user_query: "Show GC content"
    tool_call: "toggle_track(track_name='gc', action='show')"
    thought: "User wants to display the GC content track"
    expected_result: "GC content track becomes visible in the browser"
  
  - user_query: "Toggle sequence display"
    tool_call: "toggle_track(track_name='sequence', action='toggle')"
    thought: "User wants to toggle the sequence track visibility"
    expected_result: "Sequence track switches between visible and hidden state"
