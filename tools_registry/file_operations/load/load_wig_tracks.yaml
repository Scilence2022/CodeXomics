  - user_query: "Load WIG tracks for chromosome chr1 only"
    tool_call: "load_wig_tracks(filePaths=['/tracks/chr1_coverage.wig'], chromosome='chr1')"
    thought: "User wants to load WIG tracks specifically for chromosome chr1"
    expected_result: "WIG tracks loaded for chromosome chr1 only"

  - user_query: "Load WIG tracks from region 10000-50000 with bar display"
    tool_call: "load_wig_tracks(filePaths=['/data/expression.wig'], startPosition=10000, endPosition=50000, displayMode='bar')"
    thought: "User wants to load WIG tracks from specific region with bar chart display"
    expected_result: "WIG tracks loaded from specified region displayed as bar chart"

  - user_query: "Load and normalize multiple WIG tracks, merge with existing"
    tool_call: "load_wig_tracks(filePaths=['/data/new_track1.wig', '/data/new_track2.wig'], normalizeValues=true, mergeWithExisting=true)"
    thought: "User wants to load normalized WIG tracks and merge with current tracks"
