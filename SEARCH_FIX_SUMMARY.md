# Search Features Fix Summary

## Problem Identified ❌

The `search_features` function was returning "No matches found" for OR queries because:

1. **No OR Operator Support**: The original implementation used `fieldToSearch.includes(searchTerm)` which treated the entire OR query as a single literal string
2. **Literal Search**: The query `"citrate synthase OR aconitase OR fumarase"` was being searched as one complete phrase instead of separate terms
3. **Case Sensitivity**: OR operator wasn't recognized in different cases (or vs OR)

## Solution Implemented ✅

### Enhanced NavigationManager (`src/renderer/modules/NavigationManager.js`)

1. **Added parseSearchQuery Method**: 
   - Detects OR operators (case insensitive)
   - Splits complex queries into individual search terms
   - Handles both "OR" and "or" variations

2. **Enhanced Search Logic**:
   - Uses `some()` to check if any search term matches
   - Tracks which specific terms matched for better user feedback
   - Maintains backward compatibility with single-term searches

3. **Improved Status Messages**:
   - Shows how many terms were searched
   - Lists individual terms when no matches found
   - More informative feedback for complex queries

## Code Changes

### New parseSearchQuery Method
```javascript
parseSearchQuery(query) {
    // Check if query contains OR operator (case insensitive)
    if (query.toLowerCase().includes(' or ')) {
        // Split by OR operator and clean up terms
        return query.split(/\s+or\s+/i)
            .map(term => term.trim())
            .filter(term => term.length > 0);
    } else {
        // Single search term
        return [query];
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Search Logic
```javascript
// Parse search terms - support OR operator
const searchTerms = this.parseSearchQuery(searchTerm);

// Check if any of the search terms match
const isMatch = searchTerms.some(term => fieldToSearch.includes(term));

if (isMatch) {
    // Find which term(s) matched for highlighting
    const matchedTerms = searchTerms.filter(term => fieldToSearch.includes(term));
    results.push({
        // ... existing result properties
        matchedTerms: matchedTerms
    });
}
```

## How to Test ✅

### 1. Test the Original Failing Query
```json
{
    "tool_name": "search_features",
    "parameters": {
        "query": "citrate synthase OR aconitase OR isocitrate dehydrogenase OR alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase OR succinyl-CoA synthetase OR succinate dehydrogenase OR fumarase OR malate dehydrogenase",
        "caseSensitive": false
    }
}
```

**Expected Result**: Should now find citrate cycle enzymes if present in the annotation data.

### 2. Test Individual Terms
```json
{
    "tool_name": "search_features", 
    "parameters": {
        "query": "citrate synthase",
        "caseSensitive": false
    }
}
```

### 3. Test Case Variations
```json
{
    "tool_name": "search_features",
    "parameters": {
        "query": "DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase",
        "caseSensitive": false
    }
}
```

### 4. Test Complex Pathway Searches
```json
{
    "tool_name": "search_features",
    "parameters": {
        "query": "ribosomal OR tRNA OR rRNA OR ribosome",
        "caseSensitive": false
    }
}
```

## Status Messages Enhanced 📊

### Before Fix
```
No matches found for "citrate synthase OR aconitase OR fumarase"
```

### After Fix - No Results
```
No matches found for "citrate synthase OR aconitase OR fumarase" (searched for 3 terms: citrate synthase, aconitase, fumarase)
```

### After Fix - With Results
```
Found 5 matches for "citrate synthase OR aconitase OR fumarase" (3 terms searched)
```

## Verification Test Results 🧪

The enhancement was verified with a test that showed:
- ✅ OR queries are correctly parsed into individual terms
- ✅ Each term is searched independently
- ✅ Matches are found for relevant annotations
- ✅ Non-matching terms are properly identified

Example results from test:
```
Original query: "citrate synthase OR aconitase OR fumarase"
Parsed into 3 individual terms:
  1. "citrate synthase"
  2. "aconitase" 
  3. "fumarase"

Simulated annotation matching:
✓ MATCH: gltA - citrate synthase [EC:6.2.1.3]
  Matched terms: citrate synthase
✓ MATCH: acnB - aconitase B
  Matched terms: aconitase
```

## Next Steps 🚀

1. **Restart the application** to load the enhanced search functionality
2. **Test with your genomic data** using the citrate cycle enzyme query
3. **Try variations** like individual enzyme names or other pathway searches
4. **Check status messages** for detailed feedback on search results

The search function should now properly handle OR operators and find citrate cycle enzymes if they exist in your loaded annotation data.
